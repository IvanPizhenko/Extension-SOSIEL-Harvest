# What is the SOSIEL Harvest extension (SHE)?

The SOSIEL (Self-Organizing Social & Inductive Evolutionary Learning) Harvest extension (SHE) implements boundedly-rational decision-making by one or more agents. Each SOSIEL agent makes decisions using a cognitive architecture that consists of nine cognitive processes that enable each agent to interact with other agents, learn from its own experience and that of others, and make decisions about taking, and then take, (potentially collective) actions. Together, LANDIS-II and SHE have the potential to simulate adaptive management in coevolving coupled human and forest landscapes. 

# Features

- Each agent can engage in anticipatory learning, goal prioritizing, counterfactual thinking, innovating, social learning, goal selecting, satisficing, signaling, and (potentially collective) action-taking.
- Four alternative cognitive levels, with each level composed of a different combination of cognitive processes and representing an alternative approach to modeling agent behavior.
- Three alternative modes: Mode 1 is primarily intended for simulating site-scale forest management, Mode 2 is intended for simulating stand-to-landscape-scale forest management, and Mode 3 simulates agents that do not directly interact with the forest landscape.
